# The Nature of Code: Exercises

This is my attempt at doing the exercises from Daniel Shiffman’s excellent book: [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com). Reading it and working through the exercises seems like a great way to learn about how to use algorithms inspired by natural phenonema to create interactive visual software.

The entire book can [read online for free](http://natureofcode.com/book/) or you can [buy a PDF of the book with a price of your own choosing](http://natureofcode.com). Personally I like print, so I’m bought the [beautifully printed physical version](https://www.createspace.com/4068419). Daniel Shiffman also has a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vX8wT1G798&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YVljJvFRCyRM6mmF5wMPeE&index=1) on his YouTube which follows the book if you prefer that. If you do plan on doing the exercies I recommend you *not* look at my exercises as they are much more fun to do if you come up with answers to them on your own.
