# The Nature of Code: Exercises

This is my attempt at doing the exercises from Daniel Shiffman’s excellent book: [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com). Reading it and working through the exercises seems like a great way to learn about how to use algorithms inspired by natural phenonema to create interactive visual software.

The entire book can [read online for free](http://natureofcode.com/book/) or you can [buy a PDF of the book with a price of your own choosing](http://natureofcode.com). Personally I like print, so I’m bought the [beautifully printed physical version](https://www.createspace.com/4068419). Daniel Shiffman also has a [series of videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vX8wT1G798&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YVljJvFRCyRM6mmF5wMPeE&index=1) on his YouTube which follows the book if you prefer that. If you do plan on doing the exercies I recommend you *not* look at my exercises as they are much more fun to do if you come up with answers to them on your own.

This is my second attempt at doing these. [Last time](https://github.com/torbjornlunde/The-Nature-of-Code-in-openFrameworks) I tried to do it using C++ and openFrameworks, but I ended up fighting C++ and spending time figuring out what the OF equivalent of something in Processing was. Processing is great for quickly throwing something and and it in the case of this book I find it makes it easier to focus on the concepts as opposed to the particulars of the software framework I am using. (Not that I think openFrameworks is bad in any way, I just think using the language a book is originally intended for is a good idea.)
